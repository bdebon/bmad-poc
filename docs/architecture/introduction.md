# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for Tech Watch Tool, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
This project has no frontend component — it's a data pipeline that outputs to Notion. No separate Frontend Architecture Document is needed.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A** — Projet greenfield sans starter template. Setup manuel léger avec TypeScript, ESLint/Prettier. Un starter serait surdimensionné pour ce pipeline simple.
